## paack-Python

#### I used Google Colab.
Note: As it's been a couple of years since I learned Python and as I don't use it currently at work, I wasn't able to complete the last two questions that deal with executing sql queries within Python and inserting a query from one database to a different database. I apologize. 

Python script includes:

1. Can you sort a numerical list in Python?
2. Write a code to count the number of capital letters in the “drivers_table.csv” file.
3. Write a function that lists the files in a path with a specific file extension.

Failed to complete
4. Could you provide a code that executes the query you have created previously
in question 6 of SQL and export the result to a CSV?
5. Can you write a code that executes a query in one database and insert the data
in a different database?
